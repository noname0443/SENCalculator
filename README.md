# About the project
Introducing our version of the calculator. This device allows users to perform simple interactions with numbers by performing simple arithmetic operations. It is suitable for everyone who still counts by fingers, as well as for those who can not count with a column. 

# Features
1. Having our own website: we are well aware that some third-party services with a similar application ask for registration or paid subscription for use, so we do not pursue the goal of getting more money or any profit. We believe that this kind of program should be available to everyone.
2. Having simple arithmetic operations: this set includes addition, subtraction, product, power, division, and parentheses where you can shove integer expressions.
3. Availability of integers for operations: this calculator performs operations with integers. There are no real numbers or symbols to compose an expression.
4. No variables: the user does not need to enter separately the numbers for calculations and separately the operation to be applied to them, as there is a full-fledged input field for this purpose.

# How to use
The calculator is attached to the website. The user needs to visit it and enter the expression to be calculated.
